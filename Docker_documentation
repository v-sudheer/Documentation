Docker on Windows :
--------------------

Enable virtualization on windows.
run Docker for Windows installer:  will enable Microsoft Hyper-V 
 The installation provides Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Docker Machine, and Kitematic.


With the latest version of Windows 10 (or 10 Server) and the beta of Docker for Windows,
there's native Linux Container support on Windows.
That means there's no Virtual Machine or Hyper-V involved (unless you want), so Linux Containers run on Windows itself using Windows 10's built in container support.




Containers run on your host operating system which can be Linux or Windows.
Ideally you can run Linux container on Linux OS and Windows container on Windows OS.
This could be a problem in development machines if you want to develop linux container based application on Windows.
To get around this, Docker allow users to create both linux and windows container on the same windows machine 
without having to switch between OS platforms.
To achieve this, Docker provides a Linux VM for Hyper-V called MobyLinuxVM as a part of installation process. 
This VM runs Linux container and your Windows 10 host runs Windows Containers.
You cannot run both Windows and Linux Containers at the same time.
That is why Docker allows you to switch between Windows and Linux container.
With this you can run both Linux and Windows Containers side by side as a part of the same Docker Installation for Windows.


You can select which daemon (Linux or Windows) the Docker CLI talks to. 
Select Switch to Windows containers to toggle to Windows containers. 
Select Switch to Linux containers to toggle back to the default, Linux containers.

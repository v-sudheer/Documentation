The perfect patch (https://www.ozlabs.org/~akpm/stuff/tpp.txt): 
-------------------
One patch per email, with the changelog in the body of the email.

subject of patch:
---------------------
  Example subject: [patch 2/5] ext2: improve scalability of bitmap searching.
Note that various people's patch receiving scripts will strip away Subject:text which is inside brackets [].
So you should place information which has no long-term relevance to the patch inside brackets.
This includes the word "patch" and any sequence numbering.The subsystem identifier("ext2:") should hence be outside brackets.
  
The Subject: should not be a filename.
Use different Subjects for each patch in a patch series.
Subject: should concisely describe the patch which that email contains.
Bear in mind that the Subject: of your email becomes a globally-unique identifier for that patch. 
Subject should includes mention of the subsystem which it affects.
 
3.Attribution of patch:
From: John Doe <jdoe@wherever.com> should be example very first line of the email.
Downstream tools will pick this up and jdoe will get the git "Author" line.

4: Changelog of patch:
----------------------
Bear in mind that the Subject and changelog which you provide will propagate all the way into the permanent kernel record.
So the changelog should describe the patch fully:
   - why the kernel needed patching
   - the overall design approach in the patch
   - implementation details
   - testing results

No need to mention what version of the kernel the patch applies to eg:("applies to 2.6.8-rc1")
Don't include text such as "this patch does ..." or "here is patch which   ...".
There's no point in telling us that it's a patch 
Do not refer to earlier patches when changelogging a new version of a  patch. Each iteration of the
   patch should contain a standalone changelog. 

e) Add a Signed-off-by: line, as per section 11 of the
   Documentation/SubmittingPatches file in the kernel tree.
Signed-off-by: implies that you had some part in the developent of the
patch, or that you handled it and passed it on to another developer for
merging.
If your role was purely review and/or testing, please use Acked-by: instead.
Sometimes we also use Cc: in a patch to keep particular individuals
abreast of the patch's status and to give them an opportunity to review it.


f)Most people's patch receiving scripts will treat a ^--- string as the
separator between the changelog and the patch itself.  You can use this to
ensure that any diffstat information is discarded when the patch is  applied:

Example:
	Another few #if/#ifdef cleanups, this time for the PPC architecture.

	Signed-off-by: <valdis.kletnieks@vt.edu>
	Signed-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>

g) Non-changelog text:

   Sometimes you want to include text in the email which isn't designed to
   go into the changelog in the git repository.  Things like "this is already
   in Fred's tree" or "this is an updated version of last Friday's patch" or
   whatever.

   You should place such text below the "^---" separator so that it is
   auto-removed when being placed into the revision control system.
